a bit more fix, just like the little pages tab when files up above 1000 or more , web page load on cell phone ,the buttom tabs would warp over left side ,then just fix out.  thumbnails and icons improve size ,files names fix....

a bit fix ,and use AI-coding for rewrite the header banner pictue in Lazyload ,it a bit faster for load .

Additional change for details, more fit and looks better .like the titles views. 

An important things is the top banner images can use hfs3 api for load in auto, just upload what your favorit picture ,then can show on pages.
Lazyload mod can let the network transfer keep low ,and radmom-show when the page refresh. and can use Gifs and make it cool looking.~~~~

fit for Phones Pads PCs looking speciall for pictures album.

this all I just use AI coding for build , it may have some bugs ,but i keep fix in my daily use.
